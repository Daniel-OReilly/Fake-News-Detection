# Fake News Detection

---

## Background

---

Fake news can be defined as a form of news consisting of deliberate disinformation or hoaxes spread via traditional news media or online social media. This news is often written and published with the intent to mislead others, in order to damage an agency, entity, or person, and/or for financial or political gain. It can be noticed that fake news can not only damage an individual, but can influence larger populations. 
The issue of fake news gained prevalence during the 2016 United States presidential election, with Americans rating the problem larger than racism, climate change, and terrorism. In light of the 2020 election, fake news cases have been increasing; this can be attributed to a variety of factors. Due to the ease of publishing to a website, blog, or social media platform the task of reaching large audiences with false information is now trivial. 
In order to prevent the spread of fake news, it first needs to be detected. When compared to traditional Natural Language Processing problems, fake news detection contains significant differences. Although problems such as ease of spread, and societal impact are relevant, the scope of this project is to solely focus on the identification of fake news.

This classifier achieved 99.7% accuracy on the ISOT Fake News Datasets by creating a classification model
that can be fine-tuned for specific news areas. This model outperformed all other student
models in an upper level A.I course at the University of Northern British Columbia.
